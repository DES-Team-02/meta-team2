# Yocto Project - Kirkstone Version Layers Pre-requisites

This document outlines the prerequisite layers required for setting up the Yocto Project 'kirkstone' version. Ensure these layers are installed before configuring your build environment.

## Introduction
The Yocto Project's 'kirkstone' release requires specific layers to be pre-installed for successful configuration and build. This guide details the essential layers and setup instructions.

## Essential Pre-requisite Layers
- **poky/meta**: Core metadata layer, necessary for all Yocto Project builds.
- **poky/meta-poky**: Additional metadata specific to the Poky build system.
- **poky/meta-yocto-bsp**: Board Support Package (BSP) layer for Yocto-supported hardware.
- **openembedded/meta-openembedded**: Collection of layers for OpenEmbedded, including OE-Core.
- **meta-clang**: Layer for adding Clang compiler support, if not using the default GCC.

## Version Requirement
- Ensure all layers are compatible with the **'kirkstone'** release of the Yocto Project. It is crucial to use layers that match the version of your Yocto Project release to avoid compatibility issues.

## Configuration Steps
1. Clone the required layers from their respective repositories.
2. Check out the 'kirkstone' branch in each repository.
3. Update the `bblayers.conf` file to include paths to these layers.

## Additional Notes
- The setup may vary depending on the specific requirements of your build.
- Always refer to the official Yocto Project documentation for 'kirkstone' for the most up-to-date information and detailed setup instructions.
